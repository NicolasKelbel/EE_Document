caption={Calculating time period by identifying peaks and troughs of lift coefficient $C_L$ graph. The exact file paths were excluded due to privacy reasons. Code generated on the 26\textsuperscript{th} of July 2025 by \protect\textcite{chatgpt_assistance_2025} using the prompt \textit{``Write Python code to calculate the time period by identifying peaks and troughs of the lift coefficient $C_L$ graph. The code should read data from a text file containing multiple columns, where the first column represents time and the fifth column represents the lift coefficient $C_L$. It should find all peaks and troughs, calculate the time period for each peak-to-subsequent-peak and trough-to-subsequent-trough pair, compute the average time period for the peaks and troughs separately, and then take the average of those two values to obtain the overall mean time period.''}. It was subsequently edited with minor adjustments to reflect the author's intent and to ensure full functionality on the local computer on which the code was executed.}
