\section{Introduction}

Despite its widespread significance, the study of fluid dynamics is largely overlooked by the IB Physics syllabus. Defined as a field of applied science dedicated to studying the motion and interaction of fluid substances, fluid dynamics is one of the two sub-fields of fluid mechanics, the field concerned with understanding the dynamics of fluids subject to external forces \parencite{livescience_fluid_dynamics}. 

From the air we breathe to the water we consume; fluids are present in almost every aspect of our lives. Although observing fluids in action is a daily occurrence for all, countless remain unaware of the highly complex and intricate theories governing these seemingly simple and elementary phenomena. Ultimately, a profound youthful interest in cars and planes \textemdash\ everything with an engine really \textemdash\ coupled with a fascination for the motion of fluids led to the topic of this essay: vortex shedding. Specifically, this essay will concern itself with the question: \textit{How does increasing the number of faces of a bluff body (ranging from 2 to 12) affect the vortex shedding frequency in laminar flow, measured in Hz, in a 2D plane?}

Over the past century, vortex shedding has garnered a multifold of attention, with hundreds of papers published \parencite[61]{buresti1998}. This partially elucidated phenomenon is quintessential in a broad range of scientific and engineering contexts, from maintaining ubiquitous infrastructure to developing cutting-edge aerospace technologies. Bridges may suffer from vortex shedding excitation, a severe challenge which undermines their structural integrity \parencite[1040]{jurado2012}. This was exemplified by the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge on the 7th of November 1940, where vortex shedding acted as the instigating mechanism -- triggering vertical vibration that eventually transitioned into the torsional oscillations, ultimately causing its collapse \parencite{tacoma_bridge_vibrations}.

As previously mentioned, the IB Physics Guide \parencite{ib_physics_2025} does not directly concern itself with vortex shedding or, in general, the majority of fluid dynamics. Nevertheless, links can be made to section C: "Wave Behavior". Section C.1, "Simple Harmonic Motion", concerns itself with, as the name suggests, simple harmonic motion, an idealized theoretical representation of the behavior of oscillatory systems \parencite[313]{allum2023}. Fundamental concepts such as frequency and time period are discussed, ideas required in order to analyze the frequency of the vortex shedding caused by a bluff body. Furthermore, the topic of this essay also links to section C.4, "Standing Waves and Resonance". Concepts of natural frequency, vibrations and resonance are key when discussing the problems caused by vortex shedding, like the one detailed above, and the significance of the frequency of vortex shedding.
