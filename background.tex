\section{Background}

\subsection{Fundamentals of Fluid Dynamics}
Firstly, the definition of vorticity, a vortex and a bluff body must be understood. \textbf{Vorticity} is the vector quantity representing the rotational motion in a velocity field \parencite[p.~2500]{holton2003_vorticity}. A \textbf{vortex} is the circular flow of a fluid around a central axis, characterized by the vorticity in the fluid \parencite[p.~390]{nitsche2006_vortex}. A \textbf{bluff body} is defined as an object that, due to its geometry, induces significant regions of separated flow \parencite[p.~561]{navalhydro1997}. 

Next, one must distinguish between a Newtonian and a non-Newtonian fluid. A \textbf{Newtonian fluid} is a fluid in which the viscosity -- a measure of internal friction -- remains constant despite applied shear rate, whereas a \textbf{non-Newtonian} fluid exhibits a viscosity which varies with the applied force \parencite{mohn2024}. 

Moreover, one must also consider the type of flow. There are two key factors of flow when investigating vortex shedding: laminar and turbulent flow, and compressible and incompressible flow. \textbf{Laminar flow} is characterized by the layered motion of fluid particles, with no significant disturbance between the parallel layers \parencite[pp.~40--41]{versteeg2007}. On the other hand, \textbf{turbulent flow} is known to have continuous, irregular fluctuations in velocity and pressure throughout the fluid \parencite[p.~40]{versteeg2007}. A \textbf{compressible flow} is a flow in which the fluid does not have a uniform density \parencite[p.~31]{oran2002}, conversely, an \textbf{incompressible flow} is a flow in which the fluid has a constant density \parencite[p.~12]{versteeg2007}. 

This essay will analyze vortex shedding in a Newtonian fluid – water – which exhibits laminar and incompressible flow.

Lastly, two dimensionless numbers must be considered: the Reynolds and Strouhal number. The \textbf{Reynolds number} expresses the “ratio between inertial and viscous forces” \parencite{nasa_reynolds}. Given by the equation 
\[
\mathrm{Re} = \frac{\rho U L}{\mu}
\]
where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid ($kg\,m^{-3}$), $U$ is the free-stream velocity ($m\,s^{-1}$), $L$ is the characteristic length ($m$) and $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity ($kg\,m^{-1}\,s^{-1}$). This number allows one to classify if a flow is laminar or turbulent, with low Reynolds’ numbers signifying laminar flow and high Reynolds’ numbers indicating turbulent flow \parencite{saldana2024_reynolds}. The \textbf{Strouhal number} is a dimensionless parameter used to describe the periodicity of vortex shedding \parencite[p.~211]{choi2000strouhal}. It is given by the equation 
\[
\mathrm{St} = \frac{f L}{U}
\]
where $f$ is the frequency of vortex shedding ($Hz$), $L$ is the characteristic length ($m$) and $U$ is the free-stream velocity  ($m\,s^{-1}$). A high Strouhal number -- assuming both $L$ and $U$ remain constant -- indicates an increased vortex shedding frequency $f$, conversely a low Strouhal number indicates a lower $f$.


\subsection{Vortex Shedding and the Kármán Vortex Street}
Vortex shedding in a two-dimensional plane can be defined as the phenomenon in which localized regions of high vorticity are periodically released into the wake from alternating sides of a bluff body, each exhibiting an opposite rotational direction \parencite[156]{green1995fluid}. Whereas vortex shedding is the process by which vortices are formed, Kármán Vortex Street refers to the flow pattern created, a repeated structure of counter-rotating vortices \parencite[26]{govardhan2005karman}.

\end{figure}
\subsection{The Mechanism of Vortex Shedding}
Due to the fiction between a given fluid and a bluff body, there is no relative motion between them \parencite{boundaryLayerTheory_2018, jeff_defoe_bluff_2020}. Consequently, if the velocity of the bluff body is zero, the velocity of the fluid at the wall of the bluff body, with respect to the reference frame of the bluff body, is also zero: a no-slip condition. This causes a variation in velocities with distance, from zero at the bluff body surface to the free stream velocity U at a certain distance from the bluff body. The region in which this velocity gradient occurs is referred to as the boundary layer.

When a flow moves past a bluff body in a two-dimensional plane, a boundary layer develops, with increasing thickness $\delta$ from the stagnation point \parencite{fitzpatrick2016_reynolds}, the point on the leading edge of the bluff body at which the local fluid velocity is zero (with respect to the bluff body), to the back of the bluff body \parencite{learneng2022_boundarylayer}. At a certain point, the boundary layer separates from the bluff body, forming a shear layer. Under steady flow conditions, this separation occurs in a periodic and alternating manner, creating two separate, out-of-phase shear layers on either side of the bluff body.

\end{figure}

For simplification, assume the first shear layer is generated at the right of the bluff body ($SL_{1}$). Due to its vorticity, the shear layer tends to curl up, forming a vortex. As the vortex forms, the pressure in the core of the vortex decreases, acting as a sink, inducing inflow towards its center. The fluid initially present at the bottom of the backside of the bluff body is drawn into the vortex, creating space, allowing for the formation of the left shear layer ($SL_{2}$) in the \textit{formation region}. This newly created shear layer splits into three distinct flows: a flow (\textit{Flow C}) which recirculates behind the bluff body, a flow (\textit{Flow B}) which mixes with the top shear layer and a flow (\textit{Flow A}) which is drawn into the vortex ($V_{1}$).

There is a decrease in strength of the vortex being created due to \textit{Flow A} having an opposite vorticity to the vorticity of the vortex. Moreover, the opposite vorticity of \textit{Flow B} and the right shear layer effectively nullifies each other, leading to the right shear layer being interrupted and the vortex becoming detached, causing it to travel with the main flow. The vortex has been “shed”. Since the vortex moves away from the bluff body, its low-pressure influence on the area near the bluff body decreases, allowing the left shear layer to more freely develop. Now, due to the periodic nature of vortex formation, the process recurs with the shear layers switching roles. 

When considering the vortex being created from the top shear layer, the fluid at the top of the vortex will have the same velocity as the free stream velocity U, whereas the velocity at the bottom of the vortex will be of a smaller magnitude and in the opposite direction of the main flow. According to Bernoulli’s equation, a region of higher velocity must have a lower pressure and vice versa. Therefore, the bottom region of the vortex will have a higher pressure than the top region, causing a lift force which acts on the bluff body normal to the flow. The oscillation of this lift force coincides with the vortex shedding frequency. 

\subsection{The Bluff Body}
\label{sec:bluffBody}
In order to maintain a cylinder-like appearance, one of the most common bluff bodies investigated \parencite[475]{rocchi2002_vortex}, this investigation is conducted with bluff bodies which have a rectangular “tail”, in order to give each shape an equal overall length l\ in both streamwise and transverse directions.

Given the computational limitations of the computer the simulation was conducted on, an overall length $\ell$ of $1\times{10}^{-3}$ meters was chosen, therefore giving each bluff body a characteristic length $L$ of $1\times{10}^{-3}$ meters. 

In order to create the mesh necessary for the simulation, the \textit{All Triangles Method} was utilized. A global unit size of $2.25\times{10}^{-3}$ meters was applied to the fluid domain to ensure a computationally inexpensive resolution in regions of negligible interest. Conversely, near the edge of the bluff body, a significantly smaller unit size of $2.0\times{10}^{-5}$ meters was used, constituting an accurate depiction of the interaction between the fluid flow and the bluff body \parencite{ansys_learning_best_2023}. Furthermore, eight inflation layers were employed in order to accurately capture the gradients associated with boundary layer formation at the edges of the bluff body \parencite{fluid_mechanics_101_cfd_2021}. Moreover, a body of influence (BOI) with a sizing of $2.0\times{10}^{-4}$ meters was used, positioned as shown in \ref{fig:fluidDomainWithBOI} below, in order to refine the mesh in the wake region, where the vortex shedding occurs, constituting for a more accurate simulation.

\subsubsection{The OpenFoam Simulation}
The theoretical part of this EE is conducted using the open-source CFD software package OpenFOAM \parencite{noauthor_openfoam_2024}. Among the numerous solvers OpenFOAM provides, pimpleFOAM is a transient, pressure-based solver for incompressible, single-phase, also referred to as isothermal, flows \. It combines the algorithms used in the pisoFOAM and simpleFOAM solvers, enabling robust handling of transient simulations with larger time steps, allowing for improved computational performance, hence why the solver was chosen. Moreover, its ability to model both laminar and turbulent flow ensures flow conditions are accurately reflected and given that the fluctuations of lift force are sinusoidal, one can verify the flow is laminar. Utilizing reporting functions, one can extract the lift coefficient $C_{L}$, which shows the fluctuations in the lift force acting on the bluff body.
\subsubsection{Simulation Settings}
To adhere to the scope of this essay, the simulation setup is adapted from a case study provided in the Udemy course OpenFOAM for Absolute Beginners by \textcite{jayaraj2024openfoam}. The tutorial case \textit{3vortexShedding}, discussed in lecture eight, serves as a structural template and has been modified to align with the specific requirements of this investigation.

\subsubsection{FFT-based determination of the vortex shedding frequency}
FFT-based determination of the vortex shedding frequency a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to extrapolate the vortex shedding frequency by altering the lift coefficient data from a time domain to a frequency domain, allowing for the identification of its underlying harmonic frequencies \parencite[10--11]{shi2025vortex}. The dominant frequency of the FFT corresponds to the vortex shedding frequency \parencite[12]{xu_experimental_2025}. To obtain an accurate vortex shedding frequency, the FFT is only applied to the steady-state phase, when the velocity and pressure at any given point in the system remain constant \parencite{noauthor_steady_nodate}, omitting the initial transient phase, when the velocity and pressure vary over time \parencite{noauthor_transient_nodate}. 

\subsection{The Practical Investigation}
Inspired by the flow tank built by Harvard University’s Science Demonstrations Center \parencite{noauthor_vortex_nodate}, the practical part of this EE will be conducted in a self-built flow tank, utilizing a water pump a separation wall to create flow over a horizontal plate – the water pump moves the water from one side of the separation wall to the other. The regulation valve is used to modulate the flow velocity while the sponge diffuser decreases the flow velocity and ensures a uniform distribution of flow. Both a lamp and the addition of potassium permanganate crystals in front of the shape are used in order to better visualize the water flow. 

The bluff bodies were 3D printed with an overall length $\ell$ of $0.02$ meters – as described in \Cref{sec:bluffBody} – giving each shape a characteristic length $L$ of $0.02$ meters and a height of $0.04$ meters. Reference marks on the horizontal plate ensure the shape is positioned in the same position each trial. A GoPro is mounted parallel to the horizontal plate, ensuring a continuous recording of the entire horizontal plate.
